# Contributing

`winter-product-requirements` is a docs repo — the rules of the Product Requirements Framework, under `context/`, routed
from [`context/index.md`](./context/index.md). Changes target a rule file directly. This file covers changing the
framework itself; the lifecycle and commit rules for a requirements repo's product content are
[`context/contributing.md`](./context/contributing.md).

## Shared rules

This framework and the
[Engineering Requirements Framework](https://github.com/paul-gross/winter-engineering-requirements) each carry their own
copy of the rules they share, wrapped in matching `<!-- shared:<id> -->` … `<!-- /shared:<id> -->` markers. Text inside
a marker must stay byte-identical to its counterpart in the other framework, so change both in the same pass. The
layout, the file-ownership principle, and the formats of the shared files are all shared rules. Tier-specific wording —
prefixes, owner names, examples — stays outside the markers.

## Routing

[`context/index.md`](./context/index.md) is the router: every row states *when to read* the target, never what is inside
it. The root [`index.md`](./index.md) stays a short pointer to it. Adding, moving, or removing a rule file updates its
`context/index.md` row and the README's Files table in the same change; a `preq:` rule id lives only in the heading of
the rule that defines it.

## Commit messages

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with a scope:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

- Types: `docs` is the common case; also `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`.
- Scope: `winter-product-requirements`.

## Pre-push checks

Every change, including a copyedit, passes the two markdown checks CI runs:

```bash
dprint check          # dprint fmt to apply
rumdl check .         # rumdl check . --fix for the autofixable subset
```

## Delivery

- Default branch: `master`.
- Primary contributors push directly to `master` — rebase onto the latest `origin/master` first so history stays linear.
- Outside contributors: open a PR against `master`.
